# Conway's Game of Life

A populated cell will:

-Depopulate if it has one or fewer neighbors
-Depopulate if it has four or more neighbors
-Survive if it has two or three neighbors

An unpopulated cell will become populated if it has exactly three neighbors.

From these simple rules, complex behaviors emerge. 

Click a few cells to populate them. Try different patterns. Once a pattern resolves to stasis, try introducing noise back into it and see what happens.

When you're done, clear the board with the clear button.

Use the random button to generate a random pattern. Note any interesting shapes as they play out before you.

Use the speed button to make the simulation run faster.
